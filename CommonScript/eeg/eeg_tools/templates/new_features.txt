This file contains all the new features introduced in the EEG_TOOLS framework starting from 11/11/2014. (please append new entries to the top of the list)

-------------------> 3/12/2014:
started complete migration to do_operations function,

added init_operations_flags.m file, which initialize (set to 0) all the operations flags, which now are subfield of project (e.g. project.operations.do_study)
init_operations_flags.m is called by both main_eeglab_group_processing and main_eeglab_subject_processing after project_structure call and before actual flag selection


-------------------> 2/12/2014
added 

project.study.precompute.recompute              = 'on';
project.study.precompute.do_erp                 = 'on';
project.study.precompute.do_ersp                = 'on';
project.study.precompute.do_erpim               = 'on';
project.study.precompute.do_spec                = 'on';
