         <h2>What Is Linstats<a name="1"></a></h2>
         <p>Linstats is a toolbox for building, testing and making statistical inferences from linear models. There are many features
            in this toolobx that are not available in the matlab statistical toolbox including n-way ANACOVA and n-way MANOVA as well
            numerous diagnostic plots. There is also support multiple responses and linstats efficiently supports fiting models with up
            to 100s of thousands of responses. All the features share a unified model building approach.
         </p>
         <h2>Whats new<a name="2"></a></h2>
         <p>mixture of multivariate normal toolkits many new examples for every major function many new functions for plotting, fitting
            models and for data manipulation
         </p>
         <h2>Getting Started With Linstats<a name="3"></a></h2>
         <p>Unizip linstats.zip into a working directory. There should be four subdirectories. IN each of these is a readme files that
            document the purpose of each .m file. Additional documentation can be obtained by typing help "function_name" at the Matlab
            prompt

         <h2>Requirements<a name="4"></a></h2>
         <p>Linstats requires the statistical toolbox for complete functionality. Model building is still present and useful in combination
            with core matlab functions such as lscov Alternatively, if you have Satbox4.2, available from the matlab file exchange server
            you can get most of the statistical inference functions See the section below for Statbox users
         </p>
         <h2>Installation<a name="5"></a></h2>
         <p>Unzip the file and move the contents into a directory of your choice. Add the subdirectories to the top of your matlab path.
            Your done.
         </p>
         <p>Linstats has been tested using a series of unit_tests provided with this package. The unit tests are designed to demonstrate
            that major program functionality is working correctly. Each test compares results from a current run against previously saved
            hand-checked answers. The tests are run before any release, and any applicable bug reports are incorporated into the tests
            so that once irradicated they do not return.
         </p>
         <p>To run the tests just type unit_tests at the prompt. You should see a series of messages saying passed: testname. If you see
            any warnings or errors then something has gone wrong. Try moving linstats to the top of your matlab path.
         </p>
         <h2>Statbox Users<a name="6"></a></h2><pre> Linstats has been unit tested using Statbox. if you have statbox, you
 can use its probability and cumulative density function routines to
 substitute for Matlab's toolbox. There are 4 files in the fitting
 subdirectory that wrap Statbox density functions. these files all end
 in '.statbox' Remove the '.statbox' suffix from these files and make
 sure statbox is in your matlab path. Most linstats functionality should
 now be available.</pre><h2>Integration with Other Toolboxes<a name="7"></a></h2>
         <p>Linstats is modular in design and it exposes many of its inner workings though publically available functions and data structures.
            This allows more flexibility in building and testing models and will allow easier integration with other packages including
            some in matlab and others available on the file-exchange (e.g. mixed.m, ffmanova.m). For example the design matrix from a
            full-rank model can be used in a call to regstats. Alternatively the design matrix can be easily split into fixed and random
            submatrices and used in mixed.m.
